## Introduction

### Project Description
This is a website that intends to be a hub of information for anyone who is looking to deepen their knowledge about anything training related

### Project Purpose
It intends to teach people everything they need to know to take their training to new heights

### User Demographics
The expected user is anyone with an interest in strenght training and bodybuilding, wheter they are new or already have experience at the gym

### Initial Design
- After i had decided what website i wanted to make, i imediately started experimenting with designing the website
- At first i wanted to make a separate page for every muscle group but i instead opted to having each muscle group listed on the same page to make it easier for the user to find
- I first i designed the contentpage to look like a piece of paper but i changed it to have a more typical look
- I originally just hade a hamburger menu but i changed it to a navigation bar depending on the screen size
