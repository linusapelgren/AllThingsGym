# Testing

## Manual Testing
I hosted a live server from my VSCode to test the changes i made, i used this to make sure everything worked and looked as intended

## Validator Testing
- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Flinusapelgren.github.io%2FAllThingsGym%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Flinusapelgren.github.io%2FAllThingsGym%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=sv)

## Lighthouse Tool
- Some of the results aren't the best but in order to fix it i had to alter the look of the website, so I opted to not do that
