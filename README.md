## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### Project Description
This is a website that intends to be a hub of information for anyone who is looking to deepen their knowledge about anything training related

### Project Purpose
It intends to teach people everything they need to know to take their training to new heights

### User Demographics
The expected user is anyone with an interest in streght training and bodybuilding, wheter they are new or already have experience with training

### Initial Design
After i had decided what website i wanted to make, i imediately started experimenting with designing the website
Here is the initial GitHub repository and GitHub Pages link
<a href="https://github.com/linusapelgren/Portfolio-project-1-scrapped-" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>
<a href="https://linusapelgren.github.io/Portfolio-project-1-scrapped-/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>
- At first i wanted to make a separate page for every muscle group but i instead opted to having each muscle group listed on the same page to make it easier for the user to find
- I first i designed the contentpage to look like a piece of paper but i changed it to have a more typical look
-I originally just hade a hamburger menu but i changed it to a navigation bar depending on the screen size

#### Scrapping the first project
After i decided to change the look of the page entirely i decided it would be better to scrap the project and start fresh so i made a new repository.

#### Laying the groundwork
The first thing i did when starting the new projext was to lay the groundwork for the three pages i knew i wanted, the home page, exercise page and contact page.
I decided to keep some of the designs i made on the first project and improve upon them.

#### Home page
Then i moved on to designing the home page.

#### Content pages
I then started designing each of the pages that would contain the contents of the site.
There are 3 pages of content. They all contain information about different parts of training. One is for deifferent exercises, one is for nutrition and one is for different training styles

#### Contactpage
The contact page has a phone number and an email adress. There are also icons displayed beside the contact information. I kept the paper design from the last website on this page

### Future plans
The site does not provide any written examples of exercises, so that would be one thing i would like to add.

There is a navbar at the top of the page. For screens of width less than 768px, the navbar is hidden.

Clicking on the hamburger icon will toggle the sidenav, which expands from the left side.
